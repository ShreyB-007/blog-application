# 🚨 Unfiltered Digital Rant 😤💻  

This is a personal capstone project where I built a web application for those moments you just need to scream into the digital void. It's your private space to vent, refine, or nuke your thoughts without any judgment.  

---

This bad boy was forged with:

- **Node.js + Express.js** — Backend powerhouse handling routes and server logic like a champ.  
- **EJS** — Templating engine for slapping dynamic content into HTML.  
- **Vanilla JavaScript** — Client-side wizardry for features like live editing.  
- **HTML5 & CSS3** — Core layout + styling, with **Bootstrap** and custom **dark mode vibes**.

#runlocally #devsetup #quickstart

Wanna host your own digital therapy sesh? Here’s how:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShreyB-007/your-rant-app.git  # Replace with actual URL
cd your-rant-app  
npm install

## ⚠️ Important Note  
#inmemorystorage #devmode #temporarydata

All rants are stored in RAM — meaning, if you shut down the server, **poof**, they’re gone.  
This shit’s for demos and local venting only, not your life's emotional archive.
But hey, as a plus point, you can vent and no one will know a thing!

---

## 🌍 Deployment (Take It Live)  
#deploytorender #render #productionready

- `start` script in `package.json` is all set.  
- `process.env.PORT || 3000` makes it play nice with Render.  
- Hook up your GitHub repo to Render. Done. Deployed.

If you still read this far, bro... either you’re vibing *hard*, or you’re deeply broken. Either way, welcome to the digital void. 🖤
